- Add Select Options to change Zoning

- Calculate selling hours based on the HTML when pressing a button ( maybe "calculate selling hours " ? ) So we have to chance to modify the 
schedule before calculating the individual targets.

- Have the positions be "selects" and that when the schedule targets get generated (and before printing it), pass the slects to just SPANS

- Check that during weekdays cashiers do not have a lower target?

- Make sure 1 hour break gets given for only more than 7 hours shifts

- Have the program tell us 5 days in advance when an event is upcoming

- Have a way to every 2 hours change tasks ( so there is no athletes doing the same forever )

- Make sure breaks are give after maximum 5 consecutive hours

- Make the "breaks" autogenerated for the athletes have a css class so they do not look thin and uncentered

- When there is too many people working, breaks will overlap so much that after all time slots are taken, 
the program stops  working. Fix this by allowing some breaks to overlap?
