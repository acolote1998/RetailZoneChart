- Calculate selling hours based on the HTML when pressing a button ( maybe "calculate selling hours " ? ) So we have to chance to modify the 
schedule before calculating the individual targets.

- Have the program tell us 5 days in advance when an event is upcoming

- Have a way to every 2 hours change tasks ( so there is no athletes doing the same forever )

- If we edit a zone that was not originally generated that way, we can change it, but the class of the style remains the same (for example BG color
does not get updated) See how to update the class of the whole thing after updating the auto-generated schedule, changing and confirming it.
